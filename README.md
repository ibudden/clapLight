# Clap Light

An Arduino LED light controlled by claps for Thomas

Made with an Arduino MkrZero, and an 8x8 LED square.

Power supply is 5v.

A good guide in how to do it is here: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/guide-for-ws2812b-addressable-rgb-led-strip-with-arduino/

And here's one about the clapping: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/iotboys/control-led-by-clap-using-arduino-and-sound-sensor-e31809 - although this mic is a bit different (and analogue).
